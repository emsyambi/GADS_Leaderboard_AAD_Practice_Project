# GADS_Leaderboard_AAD_Practice_Project
Android application for the GADS Leaderboard. Done as a practice project.


In this project, I implemented a mobile design of the GADS 2020 Leaderboard.
The mobile App will display Top 20 learners in the Learning Leaders’ category and Top 20 learners in the Skill IQ Leaders’ category.
